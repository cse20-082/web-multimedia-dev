                <h1>The Greatest City In The World</h1>
                <p>New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, 
                    commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of 
                    many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other
                    city has contributed more images to the collective consciousness
                    of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous
                    with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping,
                    Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village
                    connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion,
                    Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images
                    of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The
                    word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life
                    and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York 
                    has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians
                    than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. Its symbol is
                    the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the
                    arena in which Emma Lazarus’s “tempest-tost” people of every nation
                    are transformed into Americans—and if they remain in the city, they 
                    become New Yorkers.</p>

                <h1>Usage of taxis</h1>
                <p>Passengers in New York City can arrange rides using smartphone apps
                     in yellow medallion taxicabs, Boro (green) cabs, and for-hire vehicles.
                      Each type of TLC-licensed vehicle has its own set of guidelines in regards to app usage, 
                    and the TLC has adopted new rules that codify these standards</p>

                <h1>The Use of the subway </h1>
                <p>The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system owned by the City of New York and leased 
                    to the New York City Transit Authority,[13] an affiliate agency of the state-run
                     Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).[14] Opened on October 27, 1904,
                      the New York City Subway is one of the world's oldest public transit 
                      systems, one of the most-used, and the one with the most stations.
                       The New York City Subway is the largest rapid transit system in 
                       the world by number of stations, with 472 stations in operation
                        (424 if stations connected by transfers are counted as single stations).
                     Stations are located throughout the boroughs of Manhattan,
                      Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx.</p>
