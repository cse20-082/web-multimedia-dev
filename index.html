            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded 
                on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists
                 in 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam)
                  in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The 
                  city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed 
                  New York after King Charles II of England granted the 
                  lands to his brother, the Duke of York. The city 
                  was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New
                   Orange for one year and three months; the city has been
                    continuously named New York since November 1674.New York 
                    City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 
                    1790, and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790.
                    The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as 
                    they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 
                    20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its 
                    ideals of liberty and peace. In the 21st century, New
                     York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship,
                      and environmental sustainability, and as a symbol of freedom and
                       cultural diversity. In 2019, New York was voted the greatest
                        city in the world per a survey of over 30,000
                 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.[38]</p>
