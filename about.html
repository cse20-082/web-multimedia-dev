                <h1>The Greatest City In The World</h1>
                <p>New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, 
                   commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of 
                   many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other
                   city has contributed more images to the collective consciousness
                   of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous
                   with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping,
                   Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village
                   connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion,
                   Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images
                   of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The
                   word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life
                   and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York 
                   has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians
                   than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. Its symbol is
                   the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the
                   arena in which Emma Lazarus’s “tempest-tost” people of every nation
                   are transformed into Americans—and if they remain in the city, they 
                   become New Yorkers.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>As every schoolchild knows, Europe’s desire to open trade with the East inspired the explorations that discovered the New World. Giovanni da Verrazzano (1524) and Henry Hudson (1609) were part of that long effort, and they were among the first Europeans to visit and gaze at the vast expanse of New York harbour. The primary result of Hudson’s voyage, and his report of a protected anchorage near good farmland, was the Dutch West India Company’s decision to place a trading post on the southern shore of Manna-hata Island; by 1626 a settlement called New Amsterdam was established. It was not the first Dutch settlement in North America, but the advantages of its location made it immensely valuable. In May 1626 Peter Minuit arrived with orders to secure title to the land. He quickly negotiated the real estate deal of the millennium, purchasing the area from a band of Native Americans who probably did not own it for trade goods worth the equivalent of 60 guilders (converted to the legendary $24). Minuit and his successor governors knew that expanding Dutch access to furs and trade were their primary tasks, and commerce fueled city development. In 1638 a new governor reported that one-fourth of all buildings were “grog shops” devoted to sailor demands. Despite revelries and intermittent clashes with local Native American tribes, the settlement gradually moved northward, laid out farms, and expanded trade with New England and the world.

                The most famous governor of the Dutch period was Peter Stuyvesant, director general of New Netherland in 1647–64. Stuyvesant’s military background enabled him to spruce up the disorderly town, and he soon granted it recognition as an independent city (1653). The religious orthodoxy he attempted to impose on his already multicultural domain, however, soon led him to clash with the Quaker population of Flushing (1657). Ultimately, Stuyvesant was ordered by his superiors to “shut his eyes” to dissenters so long as they did not disrupt society or trade. The governor found such official blindness difficult, and his imperious nature continued to alienate town burghers. When a British fleet sent by James, duke of York (the future James II), appeared off Gravesend in August 1664, Stuyvesant discovered that no one would fight for his colony. “Old Peg Leg” was forced to surrender on September 8 without even firing a shot. Interestingly, he chose to take an oath of allegiance to the English crown and lived out his life in the city. Despite a brief Dutch reoccupation in 1673–74, the destiny of the colony (which had been renamed in honour of James) had shifted to London. Within the conquered city, resident Dutch and incoming English merchants got along quite well, and representatives of both groups constituted a city elite into the 19th century.</p>
